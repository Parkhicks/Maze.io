# Overview

This is the maze game. I have plans to make a beginning user interface where the user presses enter to get to the maze then after the first maze the computer will automatically generate a new map. I chose to do this maze game to relearn JS as I'll need to be proficient in it to script with ARCGIS in a future model.

I know this is probably the most horrribly inneficient maze game ever and it barely works but I was able to learn a lot from it and am okay with where it is now. I'll continue to work on this and make it better.

You can run this game by going into the MAZE GAME folder and getting into the index.html file and launching the live server, the HTML, CSS, and JS are all linked together and your game should start. Use the arrow keys to move the player.

# Development Environment

I used basic HTML, CSS, & JS. The maze is both a js array where the player is represented by a posistion in that area and all the walls and spaces are as well. Additionally the maze is represented graphically in the html and css for the user to see.

# Future Work

* I need to fix the player alignment with the map grid. For some reason it doesn't line up despite having the move be the same thickness as the blocks in the maze.
* I need to add a starting screen where the player can input there name and then create a scoreboard to host the top times. Also need to add a timer
* Want to make the maze so it can be randomly generated so after the first maze there is always another one.
